Exact CCD: Efficient Geometrically Exact Continuous Collision Detection

Released into the public domain by Tyson Brochu and Robert Bridson, 2012.
Modified by Geoffrey Irving.

To use, create a RootParityCollisionTest object by specifying the vertex positions at the time step beginning and end times, and whether the test should be edge-vs-edge or vertex-vs-triangle, then call run_test() on the object.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Compiler optimizations may cause incorrect behaviour by assuming properties of floating-point arithmetic which do not actually hold, or by using 80-bit extended-precision registers. It has been tested with GCC 4.2.1 on Mac OS X with the -O2 flag set.
